        <h3>Offspring Age and Breeding</h3>
        <p>
          Villmanity is a mod that makes it possible for the player to have children with villagers. 
          Villager will then spawn a child offspring entity that can age over time between different sizes.
          Offsprings will age each time the player joins the world at a different date, 
          this will trigger a NBT variable to increase by one and update the date to the computer time.<br><br>
